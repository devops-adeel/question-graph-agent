# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

This repository contains a single-file question-graph agent built with pydantic_graph and pydantic_ai. The application creates an interactive Q&A flow where an AI agent asks questions, users provide answers, and another AI agent evaluates the correctness of the responses.

### Core Components

- **QuestionState**: Dataclass that maintains the conversation state including the current question and message histories for both agents
- **Graph Nodes**: Four node types that form the question-answer cycle:
  - `Ask`: Generates new questions using OpenAI GPT-4o
  - `Answer`: Prompts user for input and captures their response
  - `Evaluate`: Evaluates answer correctness and provides feedback
  - `Reprimand`: Handles incorrect answers and loops back to Ask
- **State Persistence**: Uses FileStatePersistence to save/restore graph state to `question_graph.json`

### Key Dependencies

- `pydantic_graph`: Graph execution framework with state management
- `pydantic_ai`: AI agent framework with OpenAI integration
- `logfire`: Observability and logging (optional - uses 'if-token-present' mode)
- `groq`: BaseModel for structured outputs

## Common Commands

### Running the Application

```bash
# Generate a Mermaid diagram of the graph structure
uv run -m question_graph mermaid

# Run in continuous mode (single session)
uv run -m question_graph continuous

# Run in CLI mode (stateful with persistence)
uv run -m question_graph cli [answer]
```

### Development

The application requires Python with `uv` package manager and OpenAI API access. State is persisted in `question_graph.json` for the CLI mode, allowing sessions to be resumed.

## Graphiti Integration Implementation Plan

### Overview
The project is being enhanced with Graphiti integration to add persistent, graph-based memory capabilities. This enables adaptive learning, personalized question generation, and cross-session intelligence.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Pydantic-First Approach**: All entities and relationships use Pydantic models for validation and type safety
2. **Temporal Awareness**: Built-in support for Graphiti's bi-temporal model
3. **Privacy by Design**: Opt-in memory features with clear data control
4. **Incremental Integration**: Can be enabled/disabled without breaking existing functionality
5. **Performance Conscious**: Async operations, caching, and non-blocking design

### Next Steps
Continue with Phase 2 tasks (2.3-2.6) to complete the relationship model layer before moving to entity extraction and Graphiti infrastructure setup.
