# GitHub Project Board Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up a GitHub Project board to track the Graphiti Integration implementation tasks.

## Overview

The project consists of 27 issues organized into 4 phases:
- **Phase 1**: Core Entity Models (Issues #2-8) - âœ… Completed
- **Phase 2**: Relationship Models (Issues #9-14) - âœ… Completed  
- **Phase 3**: Entity Extraction (Issues #15-20) - âœ… Completed
- **Phase 4**: Graphiti Infrastructure (Issues #21-27) - ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## Step 1: Create the Project Board

1. Navigate to https://github.com/devops-adeel/question-graph-agent
2. Click on the **Projects** tab
3. Click **New project**
4. Choose **Board** layout for Kanban-style view
5. Name it: **"Graphiti Integration Implementation"**
6. Add description: "Tracking implementation progress for integrating Graphiti temporal knowledge graph capabilities"
7. Set visibility as desired
8. Click **Create project**

## Step 2: Configure Project Fields

### Add Phase Field
1. In the project, click **+ Add field** â†’ **Single select**
2. Name: **Phase**
3. Add these options:
   - `Phase 1 - Core Entity Models`
   - `Phase 2 - Relationship Models`
   - `Phase 3 - Entity Extraction`
   - `Phase 4 - Graphiti Infrastructure`

### Add Priority Field
1. Click **+ Add field** â†’ **Single select**
2. Name: **Priority**
3. Add options:
   - `High`
   - `Medium`
   - `Low`

### Add Completion Date Field (optional)
1. Click **+ Add field** â†’ **Date**
2. Name: **Completed On**

## Step 3: Add Issues to Project

1. Click **+** â†’ **Add item from repository**
2. Search and select all issues (#1 through #27)
3. Click **Add selected items**

## Step 4: Organize Issues by Phase

### Phase 1 - Core Entity Models (Completed)

- Issue #8: 1.7: Create entity factory functions

### Phase 2 - Relationship Models (Completed)
- Issue #9: 2.1: Create base relationship model
- Issue #10: 2.2: Define AnsweredRelationship
- Issue #11: 2.3: Define RequiresKnowledgeRelationship
- Issue #12: 2.4: Define MasteryRelationship

- Issue #20: 3.6: Implement error handling and fallback

### Phase 4 - Graphiti Infrastructure (In Progress)
- Issue #21: 4.1: Add Graphiti dependencies âœ…
- Issue #22: 4.2: Create environment configuration
- Issue #23: 4.3: Implement connection manager

- Issue #25: 4.5: Create database initialization scripts
- Issue #26: 4.6: Add connection health checks
- Issue #27: 4.7: Implement graceful fallback

## Step 5: Create Board Columns

1. Rename default columns or create new ones:
   - **Phase 1 âœ…** (for completed Phase 1 items)
   - **Phase 2 âœ…** (for completed Phase 2 items)
   - **Phase 3 âœ…** (for completed Phase 3 items)
   - **Phase 4 - Todo** (for pending Phase 4 items)
   - **Phase 4 - In Progress** (for active work)
   - **Phase 4 - Done** (for completed Phase 4 items)

2. Drag each issue to its appropriate column

## Step 6: Set Up Views

### View 1: Phase Overview (Default)
- **Layout**: Board
- **Group by**: Phase field
- **Sort by**: Issue number (ascending)

### View 2: Status Tracking
- **Layout**: Table
- **Group by**: Status (Open/Closed)
- **Sort by**: Updated date (descending)

### View 3: Timeline View
- **Layout**: Roadmap
- **Date field**: Created date
- **Group by**: Phase

### View 4: Priority Focus
- **Layout**: Table
- **Filter**: Status is Open
- **Sort by**: Priority (High to Low)

## Step 7: Automation (Optional)

1. Click **âš¡ Workflows** in the project menu
2. Enable these automations:
   - **Item closed** â†’ Move to Done column
   - **Item reopened** â†’ Move to Todo column
   - **Pull request merged** â†’ Close linked issues

## Using the Project Board

### For Daily Work
1. Check the **Phase 4 - Todo** column for next tasks
2. Move items to **In Progress** when starting work
3. Update issue comments with progress
4. Move to **Done** and close issue when complete

### For Planning
1. Use the Timeline view to see overall progress
2. Review Priority Focus view for high-priority items
3. Check Status Tracking for completion metrics

### For Reporting
- Completed Phases: 3 out of 4 (75%)
- Completed Sub-tasks: 20 out of 26 (77%)
- Remaining work: 6 sub-tasks in Phase 4

## CLI Commands Reference

Once you have the proper authentication:

```bash
# Refresh auth with project scope
gh auth refresh -s project

# Create project
gh project create --owner devops-adeel --title "Graphiti Integration Implementation"

# List projects to get the project number
gh project list --owner devops-adeel

# Add issue to project (replace PROJECT_NUMBER)
for i in {1..27}; do
  gh project item-add PROJECT_NUMBER --owner devops-adeel --url https://github.com/devops-adeel/question-graph-agent/issues/$i
done

# Create phase field
gh project field-create PROJECT_NUMBER --owner devops-adeel --name Phase --data-type SINGLE_SELECT

# View project in browser
gh project view PROJECT_NUMBER --owner devops-adeel --web
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 4 sub-tasks (#22-27)
2. Add additional phases if needed for future work
3. Consider adding milestones for major releases
4. Link pull requests to their corresponding issues

This project board provides a clear visual representation of the Graphiti integration progress and helps track remaining work efficiently.
